# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Curator is an AI-powered content curation web application built with Flask that automatically sources, analyzes, and ranks high-quality online articles using a multifactorial scoring algorithm. The system provides both manual article analysis capabilities and automated topic-based curation, delivering intelligent content recommendations through a modern, intuitive user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Manual Article Analysis

**User Story:** As a content curator, I want to submit a single article URL for analysis, so that I can receive a detailed curation scorecard with quality metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a valid article URL THEN the system SHALL fetch and parse the article content using newspaper3k
2. WHEN article content is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL calculate a composite curation score (0-100) based on multiple dimensions
3. WHEN scoring is complete THEN the system SHALL display a detailed scorecard showing overall score, component breakdowns, and key named entities
4. WHEN an invalid or unreachable URL is submitted THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
5. WHEN article parsing fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and inform the user

### Requirement 2: Automated Topic-Based Curation

**User Story:** As a content consumer, I want to enter a topic or keyword, so that I can receive a ranked feed of relevant articles automatically sourced and scored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a topic/keyword THEN the system SHALL query NewsAPI.org for recent relevant articles
2. WHEN articles are retrieved THEN the system SHALL parse and score each article using the same scoring algorithm
3. WHEN scoring is complete THEN the system SHALL display articles ranked by curation score in descending order
4. WHEN no articles are found for a topic THEN the system SHALL inform the user appropriately
5. WHEN NewsAPI requests fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide fallback messaging

### Requirement 3: Multi-Dimensional Scoring Engine

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want articles to be evaluated across multiple quality dimensions, so that the curation scores accurately reflect content value.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article is analyzed THEN the system SHALL calculate a readability score based on word count and content depth
2. WHEN an article is analyzed THEN the system SHALL calculate NER density using spaCy to identify named entities
3. WHEN an article is analyzed THEN the system SHALL calculate sentiment score using NLTK's VADER analyzer
4. WHEN an article is analyzed THEN the system SHALL calculate TF-IDF relevance score using scikit-learn
5. WHEN an article is analyzed THEN the system SHALL calculate recency score based on publication date
6. WHEN all component scores are calculated THEN the system SHALL combine them using configurable weights into a final score

### Requirement 4: Modern User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with a clean, modern interface, so that I can efficiently navigate and understand the curation results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the homepage THEN the system SHALL display two clear entry points for manual analysis and topic curation
2. WHEN displaying scorecard results THEN the system SHALL show the final score prominently with visual breakdowns
3. WHEN displaying topic curation results THEN the system SHALL show article cards with title, score, summary, and source link
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL apply dark mode theme with glassmorphism and Material You design principles
5. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display responsively using mobile-first design

### Requirement 5: Configuration and Security Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want sensitive configurations to be managed securely, so that API keys and settings are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load API keys and configurations from environment variables
2. WHEN scoring weights need adjustment THEN the system SHALL allow configuration through a config dictionary
3. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and response validation
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log appropriately without exposing sensitive information
5. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL never commit secrets to the repository

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when errors occur, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits invalid input THEN the system SHALL validate URLs using appropriate libraries
2. WHEN unparsable articles are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully and inform the user
3. WHEN NewsAPI returns empty responses THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate user feedback
4. WHEN system errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error pages (400/500 templates)
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on correct input format

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability Considerations

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle multiple requests efficiently, so that users experience responsive performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing topic curation requests THEN the system SHALL handle multiple API requests efficiently
2. WHEN NLP analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL optimize processing time for user experience
3. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance
4. WHEN deployed in production THEN the system SHALL support queue-based processing for heavy operations
5. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support containerized deployment options
